%MUMAX_DATA_EXTRACTOR Summary of this function goes here
%   Detailed explanation goes here


[file,path] = uigetfile('*.*'); % interactively gets the filename
filename = [path,file]; % put it all back together

S = load(filename); % loads data from filename.

real = S.OOMMFData; % extract the actual B data out

rep = size(real); % find out how big it is, to locate the data in struct

usize = rep(2:4); % this is the x,y,z size


% extract the data. You have to resize as it thinks its an n-n-n-1 matrix. 
Bx = real(1,:,:,:,1);
Bx = reshape(Bx, usize); 

By = real(1,:,:,:,2);

Bz = real(1,:,:,:,3);
